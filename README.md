# Random-Graph-Project

This python project includes 3 parts:

1. The first section in main.py is code for manually encoding a graph into the Python-igraph program.
2. The second section is code for utilizing one of igraph's many different random graph generators (in this case, the Erdos-Renyi graph) to generate a "random" graph. 
3. The third section is code for utilzing my own algorithm to generate random graphs 

In this repository, there are also Python files that I used for finding the longest simple path in a graph and the code for my random graph generation function in the third section of the main file.
